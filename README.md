# What is Gamma?

Gamma introduces a next-gen decentralized exchange providing liquidity, an auto-farming stablecoin, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on the Fantom network. 
Gamma allows users on the [Fantom Network](https://fantom.foundation/) to trade directly from their wallets rather than through a 3rd-party -- your tokens never leave your custody, and are 100% owned by you. Further, low trading fees and high liquidity makes Gamma an attractive platform to trade with, and also helps provide a broad range of support to various facets of the Fantom community -- to continuously adapt to the changing markets by continuing to provide value to both token holders and the community. Gamma provides the following features:

1. High-efficiency swapping (fork of Uniswap; made more gas-efficient)
2. Yield Farming
3. Capital-efficient Lending & Borrowing Protocol
4. Auto-farming Stablecoin (`gamUSD`)
5. Secure Cross-chain Bridge
